            <p class="paragraphs">My personal Music Hall of Fame (Sal√≥n de la Fama [SDLF] in spanish) is a collection of my favorite songs that I started in January 2025. You can think of this as my personal canon of the music I love the most.</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">The premise is simple: [1] I only add 16 songs at the end of every month, creating a monthly "class" like in sport hall of fames. 
                [2] I can only add two songs by a specific artist per class, and only 1 song per album to a specific class, to promote variety. 
                [3] I can only add a song to the SDLF the month after I originally heard it, in order to prevent recency bias.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraphs">The first 3 classes, the classes of 2022, 2023 and 2024, are made up of my favorite songs that I listened to in those years. However, starting in January 2025, the classes are monthly, not yearly.</p>
