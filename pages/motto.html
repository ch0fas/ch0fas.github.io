            <p class="paragraphs">Welcome to my website! I decided to make this site to learn the basics of web development. I also wanted to write the website with as little outside dependencies as possible, which means all of the code is plain HTML, CSS & JavaScript (except for <a href="https://www.papaparse.com">one JS package</a> to work with CSV files).</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">The homepage is loosely inspired by the front page of the print edition of The New York Times (and other newspapers in general). I have a small collection of NYT print editions because of their covers (for example, I have their cover for May 9th, the day after Pope Leo XIV was elected).</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">I also wanted this website to not only be a place for my technological projects and job prospects, but a corner of my own creativity. Pages such as the <a href="music_registry.html">Music Registry</a> and my writing section reflect this.</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">Thank you for visiting my site. If you want to know more about me specifically, <a href="me.html">click here</a>, or go back to the home page to explore all of the sections and easter eggs (there's at least one on each page) that can be found.</p>
