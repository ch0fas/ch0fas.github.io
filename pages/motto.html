            <p class="paragraphs">Welcome to my website! I decided to make this site to learn the basics of web development. I also wanted to write the website with as little outside dependencies as possible, which means all of the code is plain HTML, CSS & JavaScript (except for <a href="https://www.papaparse.com">one JS package</a> to work with CSV files).</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">The homepage is loosely inspired by the front page of the print edition of The New York Times (and other newspapers in general). I have a small collection of NYT print editions because of their covers (for example, I have their cover for May 9th, the day after Pope Leo XIV was elected).</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">I also wanted this website to not only be a place for my technological projects and job prospects, but a corner of my own creativity. Pages such as the <a href="music_registry.html">Music Registry</a> and my writing section reflect this.</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">Thank you for visiting my site. If you want to know more about me specifically, click here, or go back to the home page to explore all of the sections and easter eggs (there's at least one on each page) that can be found.</p>
