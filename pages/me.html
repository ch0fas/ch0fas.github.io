            <p class="paragraphs">Hi! My name is Sofia üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è. I was born in Mexico City but currently live in Guadalajara. I use feminine (she/her) pronouns.</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">I am a Data Science student and aspiring software developer. For specific information about my skills you can check out my CV in the link above. This section is more focused on me personally.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="me_about_2">
            <p class="paragraphs">I was born on April 17th, 2005, a few hours before the start of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_conclave">that year's papal conclave</a> and grew up in Toluca, a city near Mexico City. 
                I can attribute my early interest in computers to my older brother, and to the Windows XP machine we had at my house. </p>
            <p class="paragraphs">My brother taught me things like how to install Minecraft mods and how to use a torrenting client, which made me learn the basics of how computers work and how programs are utilized. I got my first laptop when I was 10 years old, just after moving to Guadalajara, a city which is the love of my life.</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">I became interested in Data Science at age 17 after attending a career counseling course. We were shown a demo on 
                digit recognition using the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist">MNIST Database</a> which blew my mind at the time. By the end of that session, I knew I wanted to study Data Science and began learning Python that very same night. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraphs">I currently study Data Science and Engineering at the <a href="iteso.mx">Instituto Tecnol√≥gico y de Estudios Superiores de Occidente, ITESO</a>
            here in Guadalajara.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraphs">Outside of computers, I have been a huge aviation geek for much of my life. I am mostly interested in the 
                logistics of route planning and how different aircraft types are used in different circumstances. Commercial aviation is one of the many wonders of the modern world.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraphs">In the last 3 years or so I have also developed a big interest in music. 
                My favorite genres are hip-hop, pop and rock; some of my favorite acts are Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West (who I disavow), Taylor Swift, The Strokes, Zo√©, Daft Punk, Gustavo Cerati and James Blake. You can see the list of all the albums I've heard right <a href="music_registry.html">right here.</a>
